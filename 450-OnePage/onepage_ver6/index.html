				<h3>저를 소개합니다. </h3>
				<p>
					Hi guys, This is Donna from South Korera. I am so sleepy now. It's been raining more 10 consecutive days.
					Everthing seems so humid and soggy. I wann wash my futon and dry it under the sun. I have 3 pots which are
					sweet basil, lettuce, and mustard. Honestly my mustard, Tardy is getting closer to the end.... It is so
					natural that mustard and lettuce cannot survive in summer, hot weather. I knew that but it still makes me so
					sorrow. Tardy is blossoming yellow lil flowers that I didn't expect. Letty is getting weaker and Witty is
					getting bigger and bigger.Now I am learning HTML,CSS,Javasctipt. They are so confusing and I am not sure I can
					really do this as my job and career. But I am sure that it is clear to study them in English. Coding terms in
					Korean is much confusing and difficult to understand.

					be let it be let it be. Whisper words of wisdom, let it be.

				<h3>내가 가진 기술</h3>
				<p>Let me take you down, cos I'm going to Strawberry Fields
					Nothing is real and nothing to get hung about
					Strawberry Fields forever

					Living is easy with eyes closed
					Misunderstanding all you see
					It's getting hard to be someone but it all works out
					It doesn't matter much to me
					Let me take you down, cos I'm going to Strawberry Fields
					Nothing is real and nothing to get hung about
					Strawberry Fields forever

					No one I think is in my tree
					I mean it must be high or low
					That is you can't you know tune in but it's all right
					That is I think it's not too bad
					Let me take you down, cos I'm going to Strawberry Fields
					Nothing is real and nothing to get hung about
					Strawberry Fields forever

					Always, no sometimes, think it's me
					But you know I know when it's a dream
					I think I know I mean a "Yes" but it's all wrong
					That is I think I disagree
					Let me take you down, cos I'm going to Strawberry Fields
					Nothing is real and nothing to get hung about
					Strawberry Fields forever
					Strawberry Fields forever
					Strawberry Fields forever
